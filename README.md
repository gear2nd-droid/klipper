Welcome to the Klipper project!

Klipper is a 3d-Printer firmware. It combines the power of a general
purpose computer with one or more micro-controllers. See the
[features document](https://www.klipper3d.org/Features.html) for more
information on why you should use Klipper.

To begin using Klipper start by
[installing](https://www.klipper3d.org/Installation.html) it.

Klipper is Free Software. See the [license](COPYING) or read the
[documentation](https://www.klipper3d.org/Overview.html). We depend on
the generous support from our
[sponsors](https://www.klipper3d.org/Sponsors.html).

The 6-axis modified klipper is very different from the basic klipper. Do not use it if you do not have the skills to create your own kinematics. Do not request official support. Also, I cannot go so far as to support users who may lack the skills.

For mainsailos version: 1.2.1
